# nodejs-web-yuv-demo
This is a simple demo where the backend uses Node.js to read a video and transmit it to the frontend in the format of YUV data stream. The frontend receives the video stream and renders it as a video playback using a canvas.

```cmd
yarn install
node src/server
```
then open http://localhost:3000/
